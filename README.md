# Invisible_cloak

How it works:
1. Capture and store the background frame.
2. Detect the red colored(or other color) cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.  
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.
